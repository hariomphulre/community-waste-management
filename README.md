## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/pnpm
- Supabase account
- OpenRouteService API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd community-waste-management
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORS_KEY=your_openrouteservice_api_key
```

4. **Initialize the database**

Run the SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```bash
# File: scripts/init_database.sql
```

This creates:
- `profiles` table (user metadata)
- `waste_reports` table (report data)
- Row Level Security policies
- Storage buckets for images

5. **Run the development server**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
